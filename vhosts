1. Make sure that your system has Apache Web Server installed. Verify that the server is running, listening for HTTP 
connections on port 80.

    [root@tcox5 httpd]# telnet localhost 80

    Trying ::1...

    Connected to localhost.

    Escape character is '^]'.

    helo

    501 Not Implemented

    helo to /index.html not supported.

    Connection closed by foreign host.

 

2. Move to the appropriate directory and list the available VHOSTS (in the example below, we created a 'vhost.d' 
directory for just vhost files). Create a new VHOST called "XXX.mylabserver.com" where XXX matches the name of 
your Linux Academy Lab Server as display in your server tab, add the .conf extension to the end of the file. 
As part of the name, differentiate the HTTP version of the file so that we can create a separate configuration for 
HTTPS in a later exercise.

    [root@tcox5 httpd]# cd vhost.d

    [root@tcox5 vhost.d]# ll

    total 8

    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 118 Aug 29 17:22 tcox5.mylabserver.com_http.conf

    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 228 Aug 29 17:44 tcox5.mylabserver.com_https.conf

    [root@tcox5 vhost.d]# cat tcox5.mylabserver.com_http.conf 

3. Edit that configuration file so that is contains the appropriate sections and variables for the site path, error 
and access logs and the server name and any aliases. Display the contents once completed.

    (NOTE: VirtualHost *:80 Definition)

    ServerName tcox5.mylabserver.com

    ServerAlias tcox4

     

    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/tcox5

 

4. Create a directory to contain your custom VHOST site files. Once created, add the following HTML code to a file in 
that directory called 'index.html'

  -XXX.MYLABSERVER.COM

  - Please note: replace 'xxx' above with the name of your Linux Academy Lab Server as indicated in the server tab of the site

    [root@tcox5 httpd]# mkdir /var/www/html/tcox5

    [root@tcox5 httpd]# echo "XXX.MYLABSERVER.COM" >> /var/www/html/tcox5/index.html

5. Execute the appropriate command to enable that new VHOST configuration on the site. Restart the web server. Once 
restarted, browser (by NAME) to the site and verify that the file created in Step #4 is what appears.

    [root@tcox5 httpd]# systemctl restart httpd

    (NOTE: You will have to open a web browser and navigate to the site by NAME to see the new index.html page we created)
